# VendorQ

VendorQ is a focused B2B tool for SaaS companies that need to answer enterprise security questionnaires without slowing down sales.

It helps teams reuse consistent, source-backed security answers across customer reviews.

## What VendorQ does

- Centralizes approved security questionnaire answers
- Keeps answers consistent across customers and reviewers
- Links each answer to a clear internal policy or source
- Reduces back-and-forth during enterprise security reviews

## What VendorQ is not

VendorQ is intentionally narrow.

- Not a full GRC platform
- Not a continuous compliance or monitoring tool
- Not an audit management system

If you are looking for end-to-end compliance automation, VendorQ is not the right product.
