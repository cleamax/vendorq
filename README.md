# VendorQ

**VendorQ helps SaaS teams answer enterprise security questionnaires without stalling sales.**

Security questionnaires are rarely a security problem —  
they’re a **sales bottleneck**.

VendorQ is a focused B2B tool that helps teams reuse consistent, source-backed security answers instead of rewriting the same responses for every customer.

## 🚧 Project status

**Early-stage / MVP in active development**

This project is intentionally narrow in scope.  
VendorQ is *not* a full compliance or GRC platform — and that’s the point.

---

## 🧠 The problem

If you sell SaaS to enterprise customers, you’ve probably seen this:

- Security questionnaires arrive late in the sales cycle
- Answers live across Google Docs, spreadsheets, Slack threads
- The same questions are answered again and again
- Reviewers ask follow-up questions because answers lack clarity or sources
- Deals slow down — not because of missing controls, but because of friction

VendorQ exists to remove that friction.

---

## 🎯 What VendorQ focuses on

VendorQ is built for **one thing**:

> Answering enterprise security questionnaires with consistent, source-backed responses.

It helps teams:
- Reuse existing answers instead of rewriting them
- Cite the exact policy or document behind each answer
- Reduce back-and-forth with security reviewers
- Move deals forward without blocking sales

---

## ❌ What VendorQ is NOT

VendorQ is intentionally *not*:
- A full GRC platform
- A SOC 2 automation suite
- A continuous compliance monitoring tool
- An audit management system

If you’re looking to run compliance programs at scale, this is not the product.

## ✅ What VendorQ IS for

VendorQ is built for:
- SaaS teams selling to enterprise customers
- Founders or sales teams answering questionnaires themselves
- Teams stuck copy-pasting answers across customers
- Deals slowed down by security reviews

---

## 🧩 Core concept

VendorQ treats security answers as **reusable knowledge**, not one-off text.

Each answer:
- Is written once
- Is reused across questionnaires
- Includes a clear source (e.g. policy section)
- Can be reviewed and updated centrally

This aligns with what security reviewers actually expect:
- Clear, unambiguous answers
- Exact policy references
- Consistency across responses
- Fewer clarification emails

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack

This project is built with a pragmatic, modern stack:

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Supabase** (auth, database, storage)
- **OpenAI API** (assisted answer generation)

The focus is on clarity, maintainability, and speed — not overengineering.

---

## 🔒 Data & trust (by design)

- Data is stored privately
- Documents are not used for training
- Retention is user-controlled
- Everything can be deleted at any time

VendorQ is designed for enterprise security workflows, not growth hacks.

---

## 📌 Why this project exists (portfolio note)

VendorQ is a deliberate exercise in:
- Building a narrowly focused B2B SaaS
- Designing for enterprise trust instead of hype
- Solving a real operational problem, not a vanity feature
- Balancing product thinking, UX, and engineering

The goal is not to build “everything”,  
but to build **the right thing well**.

## 📎 Notes

This repository is part of an ongoing project and evolves continuously.  
Some parts are intentionally minimal to keep focus on the core workflow.

If you’ve ever answered security questionnaires manually,  
you’ll immediately understand why this exists.
